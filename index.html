Many ancillary businesses that today seem almost core at one time started out as journey edges.

For example, retailers often boost sales with accompanying support such as assembly or installation services.

Think of a home goods retailer selling an unassembled outdoor grill as a box of parts and leaving its customer's mission incomplete.

When that retailer also sells assembly and delivery, it takes another step in the journey to the customer's true mission of cooking in his backyard.

Another example is the business-to-business service contracts that are layered on top of software sales.

Maintenance, installation, training, delivery, anything at all that turns do-it-yourself into a do-it-for-me solution originally resulted from exploring the edge of where core products intersect with customer jouneys.

Scientists have no special purchase on moral or ethical decisions; a climate scientist is no more qualified to comment on health care reform than a physicist is to judge the causes of bee colony collapse.

The very features that create expertise in a specialized domain lead to ignorance in many others.

In some cases lay people - farmers, fishermen, patients, native peoples - may have relevant experiences that scientists can learn from.

Indeed, in recent years, scientists have begun to recognize this: the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment

includes observations gathered from local native groups.

So our trust needs to be limited, and focused.

It needs to be very particular.

Blind trust will get us into at least as much trouble as no trust at all.

But without some degree of trust in our designated experts — the men and women who have devoted their lives to sorting out tough questions about the natural world we live in — we are paralyzed, in effect not knowing whether to make ready for the morning commute or not.

The single most important change you can make in your working habits is to switch to creative work first, reactive work second.

This means blocking off a large chunk of time every day for creative work on your own priorities, with the phone and e-mail off.

I used to be a frustrated writer.

Making this switch turned me into a productive writer.

Yet there wasn't a single day when I sat down to write an article, blog post, or book chapter without a string of people waiting for me to get back to them.

It wasn't easy, and it still isn't, particularly when I get phone messages beginning "I sent you an e-mail two hours ago...!"

By definition, this approach goes against the grain of others' expectations and the pressures they put on you.

It takes willpower to switch off the world, even for an hour. It feels uncomfortable, and sometimes people get upset.

But it's better to disappoint a few people over small things, than to abandon your dreams for an empty inbox.

Otherwise, you're sacrificing your potential for the illusion of professionalism.

That perception is a construction is not true just of one's perception of sensory input, such as visual and auditory information.

It is true of your social perceptions as well — your perceptions of the people you meet, the food you eat, and even of the products you buy.

For example, in a study of wine, when wines were tasted blind, there was little or no correlation between the ratings of a wine's taste and its cost, but there was a significant correlation when the wines were labeled by price.

That wasn't because the subjects consciously believed that the higher-priced wines should be the better ones and thus revised whatever opinion they had accordingly.

Or rather, it wasn't true just at the conscious level.

We know because as the subjects were tasting the wine, the researchers were imaging their brain activity, and the imaging showed that drinking what they believed was an expensive glass of wine really did activate their centers of taste for pleasure more than drinking a glass of the same wine that had been labeled as cheaper.

That's related to the placebo effect.

Like pain, taste is not just the product of sensory signals; it depends also on psychological factors: you don't just taste the wine; you taste its price.

Turn the lights out and point the beam of a small flashlight up into one of your eyes.

Shake the beam around while moving your gaze up and down.

You should catch glimpses of what look like delicate branches.

These branches are shadows of the blood vessels that lie on top of your retina.

The vessels constantly cast shadows as light streams into the eye, but because these shadows never move, the brain ceases responding to them.

Moving the flashlight beam around shifts the shadows just enough to make them momentarily visible.

Now you might wonder if you could cause an image to fade just by staring at something unmoving.

But that is not possible because the visual system constantly jiggles the eye muscles, which prevents the perfect stabilization of images of the world.

These muscle movements are unbelievably small, but their effect is huge.

I Without them, we would go blind by tuning out what we see shortly after fixating our gaze!

It's an interesting notion: Approximate perfection is better than perfect perfection.

To balance the need for breadth (everyone feels a bit burned out) and depth (some are so burned out, they can no longer do their jobs), we ought to think of burnout not as a state but as a spectrum.

In most public discussion of burnout, we talk about workers who "are burned out," as if that status were black and white.

A black-and-white view cannot account for the variety of burnout experience, though.

If there is a clear line between burned out and not, as there is with a lightbulb, then we have no good way to categorize people who say they are burned out but still manage to do their work competently.

Thinking about burnout as a spectrum solves this problem; those who claim burnout but are not debilitated by it are simply dealing with a partial or less-severe form of it.

They are experiencing burnout without being burned out. • Burnout hasn't had the last word.

Around the turn of the twentieth century, anthropologists trained in the natural sciences began to reimagine what a science of humanity should look like and how social scientists ought to go about studying cultural groups.

Some of those anthropologists insisted that one should at least spend significant time actually observing and talking to the people studied.

Early ethnographers such as Franz Boas and Alfred Cort Haddon typically traveled to the remote locations where the people in question lived and spent a few weeks to a few months there.

They sought out a local Western host who was familiar with the people and the area (such as a colonial official, missionary, or businessman) and found accommodations through them.

Although they did at times venture into the community without a guide, they generally did not spend significant time with the local people.

Thus, their observations were primarily conducted from their verandas.

In 1890, William James described attention as "the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought."

Attention is a choice we make to stay on one task, one line of thinking, one mental road, even as attractive offramps signal.

When we fail to make that choice and allow ourselves to be frequently sidetracked, we end up in "the confused, dazed, scatterbrained state" that James said is the opposite of attention.

Staying on one road got much harder when the internet arrived and moved much of our reading online.

Every hyperlink is an off-ramp, calling us to abandon the choice we made moments earlier.

Nicholas Carr, in his 2010 book, grieved his lost ability to stay on one path.

Life on the internet changed how his brain sought out information, even when he was off-line trying to read a book.

It reduced his ability to focus and reflect because he now craved a constant stream of stimulation:

"Once I was a scuba diver in the sea of words. Now I zip along the surface like a guy on a Jet Ski."

For a long time, tourism was seen as a huge monster invading the areas of indigenous peoples, introducing them to the evils of the modern world.

However, research has shown that this is not the correct way to perceive it.

In most places, tourists are welcome and indigenous people see tourism as a path to modernity and economic development.

But such development is always a two-edged sword.

Tourism can mean progress, but most often also means the loss of traditions and cultural uniqueness.

And, of course, there are examples of 'cultural pollution', 'vulgarization' and 'phony-folk-cultures'.

The background for such characteristics is often more or less romantic and the normative ideas of a former or prevailing authenticity.

Ideally (to some) there should exist ancient cultures for modern consumers to gaze at, or even step into for a while, while travelling or on holiday.

This is a cage model that is difficult to defend in a global world where we all, indigenous or not, are part of the same social fabric.

The position of the architect rose during the Roman Empire, as architecture symbolically became a particularly important political statement.

Cicero classed the architect with the physician and the teacher and Vitruvius spoke of "so great a profession as this."

Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, a practicing architect during the rule of Augustus Caesar, recognized that architecture requires both practical and theoretical knowledge, and he listed the disciplines he felt the aspiring architect should master: literature and writing, draftsmanship, mathematics, history, philosophy, music, medicine, law, and astronomy — a curriculum that still has much to recommend it.

All of this study was necessary, he argued, because architects who have aimed at acquiring manual skill without scholarship have never been able to reach a position of authority to correspond to their plans, while those who have relied only upon theories and scholarship were obviously "hunting the shadow, not the substance."

Coming of age in the 18th and 19th centuries, the personal diary became a centerpiece in the construction of a modern subjectivity, at the heart of which is the application of reason and critique to the understanding of world and self, which allowed the creation of a new kind of knowledge.

Diaries were central media through which enlightened and free subjects could be constructed.

They provided a space where one could write daily about her whereabouts, feelings, and thoughts.

Over time and with rereading, disparate entries, events, and happenstances could be rendered into insights and narratives about the self, and allowed for the formation of subjectivity.

It is in that context that the idea of "the self [as] both made and explored with words" emerges.

Diaries were personal and private; one would write for oneself, or, in Habermas's formulation, one would make oneself public to oneself.

By making the self public in a private sphere, the self also became an object for self-inspection and self-critique.

You may feel there is something scary about an algorithm deciding what you might like.

Could it mean that, if computers conclude you won't like something, you will never get the chance to see it?

Personally, I really enjoy being directed toward new music that I might not have found by myself.

I can quickly get stuck in a rut where I put on the same songs over and over.

That's why I've always enjoyed the radio.

But the algorithms that are now pushing and pulling me through the music library are perfectly suited to finding gems that I'll like.

My worry originally about such algorithms was that they might drive everyone into certain parts of the library, leaving others lacking listeners.

Would they cause a convergence of tastes?

But thanks to the nonlinear and chaotic mathematics usually behind them, this doesn't happen.

A small divergence in my likes compared to yours can send us off into different far corners of the library.

There is an African proverb that says, 'Till the lions have their historians, tales of hunting will always glorify the hunter'.

The proverb is about power, control and law making.

Environmental journalists have to play the role of the 'lion's historians'.

They have to put across the point of view of the environment to people who make the laws.

They have to be the voice of wild India.

The present rate of human consumption is completely unsustainable.

accelerating demands of human population.

But to ask for any change in human behaviour — whether it be to cut down on consumption, alter lifestyles or decrease population growth — is seen as a violation of human rights.

But at some point human rights become 'wrongs'.

It's time we changed our thinking so that there is no difference between the rights of humans and the rights of the rest of the environment.

Our view of the world is not given to uS from the outside in a pure, objective form; it is shaped by our mental abilities, our shared cultural perspectives and our unique values and beliefs.

This is not to say that there is no reality outside our minds or that the world is just an illusion.

It is to say that our version of reality is precisely that: our version, not the version.

There is no single, universal or authoritative version that makes sense, other than as a theoretical construct.

We can see the world only as it appears to us, not "as it truly is," because there is no "as it truly is" without a perspective to give it form.

Philosopher Thomas Nagel argued that there is no "view from nowhere," since we cannot see the world except from a particular perspective, and that perspective influences what we see.

We can experience the world only through the human lenses that make it intelligible to us.

Lawyers sometimes describe ownership as a bundle of sticks. This metaphor was introduced about a century ago, and it has dramatically transformed the teaching and practice of law.

The metaphor is useful because it helps us see ownership as a grouping of interpersonal rights that can be separated and put back together.

When you say It's mine in reference to a resource, often that means you own a lot of the sticks that make up

the full bundle: the sell stick, the rent stick, the right to mortgage, license, give away, even destroy the thing.

Often, though, we split the sticks up, as for a piece of land: there may be a landowner, a bank with a mortgage, a tenant with a lease, a plumber with a license to enter the land, an oil company with mineral rights.

Each of these parties own a stick in the bundle.

Gold plating in the project means needlessly enhancing the expected results, namely, adding characteristics that are costly, not required, and that have low added value with respect to the targets — in other words, giving more with no real justification other than to demonstrate one's own talent. Gold plating is especially interesting for project team members, as it is typical of projects with a marked professional component - in other words, projects that involve specialists with proven experience and extensive professional autonomy. In these environments specialists often see the project as an opportunity to test and enrich their skill sets. There is therefore a strong temptation, in all good faith, to engage in gold plating, namely, to achieve more or higher-quality work that gratifies the professional but does not add value to the client's requests, and at the same time removes valuable resources from the project.

As the saying goes, "The best is the enemy of the good."

How you focus your attention plays a critical role in how you deal with stress.

Scattered attention harms your ability to let go of stress, because even though your attention is scattered, it is narrowly focused, for you are able to fixate only on the stressful parts of your experience.

When your attentional spotlight is widened, you can more easily let go of stress.

You can put in perspective many more aspects of any situation and not get locked into one part that ties you down to superficial and anxiety-provoking levels of attention.

A narrow focus heightens the stress level of each experience, but a widened focus turns down the stress level because you're better able to put each situation into a broader perspective.

One anxiety-provoking detail is less important than the bigger picture.

It's like transforming yourself into a nonstick frying pan.

The expansion of sports tourism in the twentieth century has been influenced by further developments in

transportation.

Just as the railways revolutionized travel in the nineteenth century, so the automobile produced even more dramatic changes in the twentieth.

The significance of the car in the development of sport and tourism generally has attracted considerable coverage and it has had no less an impact on sports tourism specifically.

Although originally invented towards the end of the nineteenth century, it started to become a mass form of transport in the 1920s in the USA and rather later in Britain.

Apart from its convenience and flexibility, the car has the additional advantages of affording access to many areas not served by public transport, as well as allowing the easy transport of luggage and equipment.

As a result, it was invaluable for the development of many forms of sports tourism but especially those which require the transportation of people and equipment to relatively remote locations.

Avian song learning occurs in two stages: first, songs must be memorized and, second, they must be practiced.

In some species these two events overlap, but in others memorization can occur before practice by several months, providing an impressive example of long-term memory storage.

The young bird's initial efforts to reproduce the memorized song are usually not successful.

These early songs may have uneven pitch, irregular tempo, and notes that are out of order or poorly reproduced.

However, sound graphs of songs recorded over several weeks or months reveal that during this practice period the bird fine-tunes his efforts until he produces an accurate copy of the memorized template.

This process requires hearing oneself sing; birds are unable to reproduce memorized songs if they are deafened after memorization but before the practice period.

It is important to remember that to achieve acceptance and use of new technologies/systems, the personal importance to the users has to be valued more highly than the degree of innovation.

However, policies and political goals are often confused with the driver's personal goals.

Societal goals and individual goals do not necessarily coincide.

For example, the policy goal behind ISA (Intelligent Speed Adaptation; a system which warns the drivers when they exceed the speed limit, and may even prevent them from doing so) could be to increase traffic safety or to increase speed limit compliance.

These goals might not be relevant to some drivers, for example, due to their feeling that safety measures are redundant because of their own personal driving skills or because speeding is not seen as a 'real crime.'

Nevertheless, they might find that the system helps them to avoid speeding tickets or they want to use the system simply because they have a general interest in innovative systems.

Speaking fast is a high-risk proposition.

It's nearly impossible to maintain the ideal conditions to be persuasive, well-spoken, and effective when the mouth is traveling well over the speed limit.

Although we'd like to think that our minds are sharp enough to always make good decisions with the greatest efficiency, they just aren't.

In reality, the brain arrives at an intersection of four or five possible things to say and sits idling for a couple of seconds, considering the options.

When the brain stops sending navigational instructions back to the mouth and the mouth is moving too fast to pause, that's when you get a verbal fender bender, otherwise known as filler.

Um, ah, you know, and like are what your mouth does when it has nowhere to go.

In one study, researchers gave more than five hundred visitors to an art museum a special glove that reported their movement patterns along with physiological data such as their heart rates.

The data showed that when people were not distracted by chatting with companions, they actually had a stronger emotional response to the art.

Of course, there's nothing wrong with chatting and letting the art slide past, but think of the inspiration those museum visitors missed out on. * Then apply that to life in general.

When we surround ourselves with other people, we're not just missing out on the finer details of an art exhibition.

We're missing out on the chance to reflect and understand ourselves better.

In fact, studies show that if we never allow ourselves to be alone, it's just plain harder for us to learn.

Other research found that young people who cannot stand being alone were less likely to develop creative skills like playing an instrument or writing because the most effective practice of these abilities is often done while alone.

→ The study above shows avoiding conversation with companions while exploring an art museum intensifies emotional response to art, suggesting that absence of alone time may inhibit personal growth and

learning.

Human speech differs from the cries of other species in many ways.

One very important distinction is that all other animals use one call for one message as the general principle of communication.

This means that the number of possible messages is very restricted.

If a new message is to be included in the system, a new sound has to be introduced, too.
After the first few tens of sounds it becomes difficult to invent new distinctive sounds, and also to remember them for the next time they are needed.
Human speech builds on the principle of combining a restricted number of sounds into an unlimited number of messages.

In a typical human language there are something like thirty or forty distinctive speech sounds.

These sounds can be combined into chains to form a literally unlimited number of words.

Even a small child, who can communicate by only one word at a time, uses a system for communication that is infinitely superior to any system utilized by any other animal.

→ In animal cries, each call represents a different message, which limits the number of possible messages, whereas human language creates an unlimited number of messages using a finite set of distinctive sounds.

"Brain plasticity" is a term we use in neuroscience.

Whether intentionally or not. "plasticity" suggests that the key idea is to mold something once and keep it that way forever: to shape the plastic toy and never change it again.

But that's not what the brain does. It carries on remolding itself throughout your life.

Think of a developing city, and note the way it grows, improves, and responds to the world around it.

Observe where the city builds its truck stops, how it crafts its immigration policies, and how it modifies its education and legal systems.

A city is always changing. A city is not designed by urban planners and then immobilized like a plastic object.

It continually develops.

Just like cities, brains never reach an end point.

We spend our lives blossoming toward something, even as the target moves.

Consider the feeling of encountering a diary that you wrote many years ago.

It represents the thinking, opinions, and viewpoint of someone who was a bit different from who you are now, and that previous person can sometimes border on the unrecognizable.

Despite having the same name and the same early history, in the years between inscription and interpretation the narrator has altered.

The word "plastic" can be stretched to fit this notion of ongoing change.

→ While some understand "brain plasticity" to mean permanence upon molding, the brain is actually capable of transformation.

People often assume that synthetic food ingredients are more harmful than natural ones, but this is not always

the case.

Typically, synthetic ingredients can be made in a precisely controlled fashion and have well-defined compositions and properties, allowing careful evaluation of their potential toxicity.

On the other hand, natural ingredients often vary appreciably in their composition and properties depending on their origin, the time of year they were harvested, the climate they experienced throughout their lifetime, the soil quality, and how they were isolated and stored.

These variations can make testing their safety extremely difficult — one is never sure about the potential toxicity of minor components that may vary from time to time.

In some cases, a natural food component has been consumed for hundreds or thousands of years without causing any obvious health problems and can, therefore, be assumed to be safe.

However, one must still be very careful.

→ The controllability of the production process for synthetic food ingredients and the variability of natural food ingredients may challenge people's commonly held assumption that the natural ingredients are more

secure.`;
